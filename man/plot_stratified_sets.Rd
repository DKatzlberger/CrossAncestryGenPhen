\title{Plot Sample Counts by Stratified Variable and Dataset Split}
\usage{
plot_stratified_sets(MX, MY, MR, g_col, title = NULL, point_size = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{MX}{A data.frame containing metadata for the test set (usually output from `split_stratified_ancestry_sets()`).}

\item{MY}{A data.frame containing metadata for the inference set.}

\item{MR}{A data.frame containing metadata for the train set.}

\item{g_col}{Character vector of column names in the metadata to stratify and plot by (e.g., c("ancestry", "sex")).}

\item{title}{Optional character string to use as the plot title.}

\item{point_size}{Numeric value controlling point/label size (currently not used in plotting directly).}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing counts per stratum and dataset split, faceted by stratification variable.
}
\description{
Creates a bar plot showing the number of samples in each dataset split
(train, test, inference), grouped and colored by stratification variables.
Each stratification column is shown in a separate facet for clear comparison.
}
\details{
This is useful for visually checking balance or representation across
strata (e.g., ancestry or condition) within each split.
