\title{Leave-One-Out Diagnostic for interaction effects}
\usage{
loo_interaction_effect(X, Y, MX, MY, g_col, a_col, feature)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data.frame of expression values for ancestry A.}

\item{Y}{A numeric matrix or data.frame of expression values for ancestry B.}

\item{MX}{A data.frame of metadata for X. Must include a column with condition/group labels.}

\item{MY}{A data.frame of metadata for Y. Must include a column with condition/group labels.}

\item{g_col}{String. Name of the column in `MX` and `MY` that defines the condition/group (must be a factor with exactly 2 levels).}

\item{a_col}{String. Name of the column in `MX` and `MY` that defines ancestry.}

\item{feature}{Character or numeric vector. Names or indices of features (columns) to test.}
}
\value{
A tidy data.frame with columns:
  \describe{
    \item{feature}{Feature name or index.}
    \item{sample}{Sample name that was left out.}
    \item{T_loo}{Interaction effect with that sample left out.}
    \item{T_obs}{Original full-sample interaction effect.}
    \item{ancestry}{Ancestry of the sample ("eur" or "afr").}
  }
}
\description{
Computes leave-one-out diagnostics for each feature by dropping each 
sample one at a time from each ancestry dataset. Shows how much each 
sample influences the interaction effect estimate.
