\title{Compute Jaccard Similarity Matrix Between Iterations}
\usage{
compute_jaccard_matrix(id_usage, role)
}
\arguments{
\item{id_usage}{A data.frame with columns \code{ids}, \code{role}, and \code{iteration},
such as the output from \code{\link{track_sample_ids}}.}

\item{role}{A character string specifying which sample role to evaluate ("test", "train", or "inference").}
}
\value{
A square matrix of Jaccard indices with dimensions \code{iterations × iterations}.
}
\description{
Calculates pairwise Jaccard indices between iterations based on sample usage.
Useful for assessing overlap and dependence in train/test/inference sets across iterations.
}
\details{
The Jaccard index is computed as:
\deqn{J(i, j) = |A_i ∩ A_j| / |A_i ∪ A_j|}
where \eqn{A_i} and \eqn{A_j} are the sets of sample IDs used in the specified role for iterations i and j.
}
\examples{
# Assume `id_usage` is created using multiple splits and track_sample_ids()
jaccard_test <- compute_jaccard_matrix(id_usage, role = "test")
jaccard_train <- compute_jaccard_matrix(id_usage, role = "train")

}
