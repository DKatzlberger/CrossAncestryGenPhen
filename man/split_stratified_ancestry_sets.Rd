\usage{
split_stratified_ancestry_sets(
  X,
  Y,
  MX,
  MY,
  id_col = NULL,
  stratify_cols = NULL,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix (samples × features) for the overrepresented ancestry group.}

\item{Y}{A numeric matrix (samples × features) for the underrepresented ancestry group.}

\item{MX}{A data.frame of metadata for X (same number of rows as X).}

\item{MY}{A data.frame of metadata for Y (same number of rows as Y).}

\item{id_col}{Optional string specifying the column name in metadata that holds sample IDs. If NULL, rownames are used.}

\item{stratify_cols}{A character vector of metadata column names to stratify on.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer to set random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A named list with:
\describe{
  \item{train}{List with `X`, `M`, and `ids` for the remaining overrepresented samples.}
  \item{test}{List with `X`, `M`, and `ids` for the subsampled overrepresented group.}
  \item{inference}{List with `X`, `M`, and `ids` for the underrepresented ancestry group.}
  \item{strata_info}{A summary list with usable, missing, and insufficient strata.}
}
}
\description{
Subsamples the overrepresented ancestry (e.g., EUR) to match the underrepresented ancestry
(e.g., AFR) for a test set, stratifying by metadata columns. The remaining overrepresented
samples are used for training. The underrepresented ancestry group is returned as the inference set.
}
\details{
This version supports tracking and subsetting using either rownames or a specified sample ID column.
