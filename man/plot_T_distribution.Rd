\title{Plot T-Statistic Distributions with Observed Values and Annotations}
\usage{
plot_T_distribution(
  x,
  features = NULL,
  statistic = c("T_perm", "T_boot"),
  title = NULL,
  point_size = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A named list output from \code{perm_interaction()} or similar, containing null distributions
and summary statistics. Must include a \code{summary_stats} data frame and either \code{T_perm} or
\code{T_boot} depending on the statistic type.}

\item{features}{Character vector of feature names to plot. If NULL, the first 9 features (columns) from the
selected null matrix are used.}

\item{statistic}{Character string indicating which null distribution to plot. Must be either \code{"T_perm"}
(for permutation) or \code{"T_boot"} (for bootstrap).}

\item{title}{Optional title for the entire plot.}

\item{point_size}{Numeric value to control relative font or point size (not actively used in this version).}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object consisting of histograms of test statistics per feature, with vertical
        lines showing observed values and either p-values (for permutations) or confidence intervals
        (for bootstraps).
}
\description{
This function visualizes empirical null distributions of T-statistics for selected features (e.g., genes)
using either permutation- or bootstrap-based inference. It overlays observed T-statistics as dashed lines,
and when bootstrapping is used, adds 95% confidence intervals as dotted red lines. For permutation-based
inference, empirical p-values are shown in the facet titles.
}
\details{
The function automatically creates facet plots for each feature selected. If \code{statistic = "T_perm"},
the observed test statistic is plotted with a dashed blue line, and the empirical p-value is included
in the facet label. If \code{statistic = "T_boot"}, the observed value is plotted with a dashed blue line
and the 95% CI is shown using dotted red lines.

If the required null distribution is missing from the input object, the function will throw an informative error.
