\title{Subset metadata and expression by ancestry and phenotype}
\usage{
filter_phenotype_ancestry(
  X,
  M,
  g_col,
  a_col,
  g_levels,
  a_levels,
  covariates = NULL,
  plot = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Matrix of features (rows = samples, cols = features).}

\item{M}{Data frame of sample metadata (rownames = sample IDs).}

\item{g_col}{Column in `M` with phenotype labels.}

\item{a_col}{Column in `M` with ancestry labels.}

\item{g_levels}{Character(2), phenotype levels to keep (order sets factor).}

\item{a_levels}{Character(2), ancestry levels to keep (`X`, `Y`).}

\item{verbose}{Logical, print summary (default TRUE).}
}
\value{
List with elements `X` and `Y`, each a list of:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{meta}: filtered metadata
    \item \code{counts}: filtered matrix
  }
}
\description{
Filters metadata (`M`) and matching matrix (`X`) to two given ancestry
levels and two phenotype levels, then splits into X/Y groups.
