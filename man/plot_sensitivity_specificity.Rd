\title{Plot sensitivity and specificity as a bar plot.}
\usage{
plot_sensitivity_specificity(
  y_true,
  y_selected,
  target = 1,
  title = NULL,
  x_label = NULL,
  y_label = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_true}{Vector of true labels (numeric, factor, or logical).}

\item{y_selected}{Vector of predicted labels (numeric, factor, or logical).}

\item{target}{The value that should be treated as the positive class.}

\item{title}{Optional plot title.}

\item{x_label}{Optional x-axis label.}

\item{y_label}{Optional y-axis label (default: "Value label").}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing sensitivity and specificity as bars.
}
\description{
Computes sensitivity and specificity for binary classification tasks.
Takes binary vectors of true and predicted labels.
Uses the `target` value to define the positive class.
Sensitivity and specificity are computed from TP, FP, FN, TN counts.
Plots the results as two bars with percentage labels.
