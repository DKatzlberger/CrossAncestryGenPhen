\title{Plot Mean-Variance Relationship with Density Overlay}
\usage{
plot_mean_variance_density(
  X,
  title = NULL,
  x_label = NULL,
  y_label = NULL,
  offset = 0.5,
  density_grid_size = 500,
  outlier_quantile = 0.75,
  point_size = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data.frame with samples in rows and genes
in columns. Typically the output from limma::voom (i.e., voom(data)$E).}

\item{title}{Optional title for the plot.}

\item{x_label}{Optional label for the x-axis.}

\item{y_label}{Optional label for the y-axis.}

\item{density_grid_size}{Resolution of the KDE grid (default is 500).}

\item{outlier_quantile}{Genes below this KDE quantile are shown as outliers (default is 0.75).}

\item{point_size}{Size of points. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object displaying the mean-variance density plot.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the relationship between the mean and variance
of log2-transformed expression values across genes. A smooth 2D kernel
density estimate is shown as a white-to-blue background, and genes
falling in low-density regions are highlighted as black dots.
