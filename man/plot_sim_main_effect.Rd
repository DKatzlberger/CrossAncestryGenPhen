\item{intended_main_effect_X}{Optional numeric intended log2FC for X ancestry.}

\item{intended_main_effect_Y}{Optional numeric intended log2FC for Y ancestry.}

\item{effect_thr}{Optional numeric threshold for interaction effect band (e.g., 1).}

\item{features}{Optional character vector of feature names to label.}

\item{title}{Plot title.}

\item{x_label}{X-axis label.}

\value{
A ggplot object.

\description{
Create a scatter plot comparing realized or observed log2 fold-change
effects for two ancestries (populations). This helps visualize how the 
main effects in X and Y relate to each other, highlighting features 
that are DEGs in one or both populations.
}
\details{
Points are colored by DEG status (Both, X-only, Y-only, None) and shaped 
by presence of an interaction effect. Intended effect sizes and a 
biological threshold band can be shown for reference.
